    <h3><a href="action:///display_changelog">Show changes</a></h3>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    Please report bugs and file feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/felixwiemuth/LinCal">Github</a>. Please also report problems with translations.

    <h3>Known problems</h3>
    Notifications may not be reliably shown at the expected time and they might be shown more than once. Please report occurrences of this problem. If notifications are not shown after a reboot (please also report), start the app once and disable and reenable notifications for any one of the calendars.</li>

    <h3>Planned features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Display non-link content when clicking notifications</li>
      <li>Possibility to show link before opening when clicking a notification</li>
      <li>Option to not display notifications before the screen is turned on - this avoids accoustic or visual signals of a notification</li>
      <li>Default settings for notifications in addition to the calendar-specific settings</li>
      <li>Open file manager from app to choose calendar to add</li>
      <li>Improved layout/design</li>
      <li>Richer content for notifications: custom included offline media, HTML pages</li>
      <li>Widget to show today's notifications on click</li>
      <li>Obfuscated calendar files: App makes file unreadable before sending it to someone, to not allow others to see entries in advance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Translations</h3>
    The app is translated to the following languages (thanks to the respective translators):
    <ul>
        <li> Japanese (by <a href="https://github.com/naofum">naofum</a>)</li>
        <li> German (by <a href="https://github.com/felixwiemuth">felixwiemuth</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jaller94">jaller94</a>)</li>
    </ul>
